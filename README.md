# Huffman-Tree-School-Project
This repository contains the code for our final project in Data Structures II. It was made to show that we could use the huffman coding to compress and decompress ASCII files. As this is a school project this is very rough, please keep this in mind. It does not truly compress as it simply writes the binary as zeroes and ones in a text file. It also does not export the tree required. Instead, it uses the tree still in memory to decompress all at once. 

I plan on rectifying all of these issues when I totally redesign this program for myself. I also plan on changing the program to allow for non-ASCII files.

This was a group project with:

Shailendra Singh, Riley Huston, Tatiana Olenciuc, Adam Scott and Christine Nguyen
